### Image Segmentation Kaggle Notebooks Readme

#### Overview
This readme provides instructions for running two types of image segmentation models: YOLO and Fast R-CNN. Separate Kaggle notebooks are available for each model.

#### YOLO Notebooks
1. **YOLOv8_2**: Trained on both agriculture and society images.
2. **YOLOv8_v1**: Trained exclusively on society images.

##### Instructions:
- Open the respective Kaggle notebook links.
- Run all code sections sequentially.
- The dataset will be automatically downloaded and the model trained.

##### Notes:
1. For YOLOv8_2 model testing, add test images manually (provided in the datasets folder).
2. Ensure the PenFudanPed dataset is added for Fast R-CNN notebook if not already included.

#### Web-App Usage
Access the web-app link to interact with the deployed YOLOv8 model. Upload images to observe segmentation results firsthand.
